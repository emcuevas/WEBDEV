# WEBDEV

# This is my first project I want to share with all of you developers out there. I need to atleast start somewhere. I am not sure if I am using github as correctly as needed.

PROJECT:

-- So basically, it is just a simple website for event and planning. I am not wanting to use any framework on this one. I want to learn all the aspects needed, from designing, adjustments of containers, do's and dont's and responsive layout without the help of a framework. I am open to all feedbacks that I can get. I want to pursue a career on webdev, even if it takes years of practice. I want to start somewhere already.



COLOR:
-- LIGHT-ISH PINK and BLUE, but not limited to this colors. 


CONTAINER/CAROUSEL:
-- I didnt use JS on the carousel. I have followed a video on youtube where the developer used radio buttons and z-index for next and previous slides. 


OVERALL:
-- I am quite happy with what I have achieved so far. But still I feel that I have a lot to learn and I still can improve with the help of you guys.



As I said earlier, I am open for criticsm to build myself up as a developer/programmer. Thank you a lot in advance.
